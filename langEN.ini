1070=My dream is to make you wingless weirdos fly!| Don't you want to be just like me?| ..I would.
1071=Want to give it a try?| All it takes is a simple press of the @2jump button whilst in mid-air@0 and hope it works!
1072=@6Of course I tested it!@0| Well, it hasn't worked YET, but I just fly away if it fails.| Wait...| you can't do that...| oh well, go for it!
1073=Hey why are you still here?| I need this for my experiment!| @2Just jump again in midair@0 so I can see if you live or d-.... uhh... try it out!

1074=Wow, my invention worked?!| To be totally honest I wasn't so sure..| I just needed a test dummy.. uh.. @6brave chap@0 like yourself to try it!
1075=The area up ahead is off limits and all I've heard are deafening sounds all afternoon coming from that way..
1076=You're still going?| Well, I guess I can't stop you.| I'm uh..| going to need my leaf back though.

1082=I heard some rumors about these lands from my home town and decided to come test out my gloves.
1083=The Clublins across Rosantica sure know how to fight, @6I nearly lost an arm@0 to those wolf riders up in @3Mistral Peak@0.
1084=If you must go, watch out for @2red flowers@0 on walls.| Rosanticans from ancient times hid their relics behind false walls marked with these flowers.
1085=I'm sure they wouldn't mind you giving them to @3Yombal@0 for a pretty penny.| Good luck.

//(16)Belmin (Sanctia filler)=
1086=Whoa, hold up!| You're the wee laddie everyone is talking about..| You're really heading up the mountain, huh?
1087=Well aren't you @1Mr. Adventure@0..| I'd say be careful but that's not a very heroic thing to say so..| uh..| @6GO FOR IT!@0

1091=I bring my boys out here everyday but something has them shook and they'll not move an inch..| @6We should probably head back home@0.
1092=To the east is the @3Crimson Sanctuary@0, a structure built by @2Sorrell@0,| I'm not quite sure what its purpose is, though..

//KANOU=
1094=Hey stranger!| I don't believe we've met.. I'm Kanouky, but my friends call me Kanou.
1095=I stumbled upon this island by complete accident!| There was this strong sense of energy that seemingly pulled me toward it, I'm not sure if that is good or bad!
1096=Either way, I'm yet to explore this island before moving on.| See you around, friend!

//(24)Seneca=
1097=We heard something @6rip@0 through this area all the way from Sanctia,| @1Loretta@0 won't tell me but she seems to know what it is..
1098=A whole load of goblins just fled up into the caverns too.| I've never seen that before, something must have startled 'em.
1099=If you must go on ahead then you're a bigger fool than I thought, just don't let down your guard.

1103=You seem like a nice man.| Can you keep a secret?
1104=If you go through this big door right here you can go up a biiiiig lift to the top.. @6(My dad says so anyway)@0.
1105=Buuuut..| it's locked.| I usually stand guard to make sure no strangers go in or out but without a key that's impossible!
1106=My dad's name is @1Tholmin@0.. @6(Which is also my name, weird huh!)@0| He'll be at our village in @3Woodshade Settlement@0, ask him for the key.

1116=The dangers of the mountain are great, and yet here you stand.| I sense a great purpose in you, boy.
1117=I've lived here in isolation for long, keeping watch over these mountains, easing the blistering winds to the best of my abilities.
1118=The mountain is growing more restless as of late.| It seems my time here might be nearing its end.
1119=Please, take this as a token of gratitude for this moment we've shared.| It's not much, but may it help you on your journey.
1120=Be safe...

//Cael=
3023=Well look who it is, hey neighbor! Have you noticed those yellow bars above these baddies heads? It's a little @6weird@0, but useful!
3024=Once the bar fills completely, they enter a stun state. You can smack em freely for a few seconds until they come back to their senses.
3025=Don't forget to dodge roll to avoid incoming attacks! Enemies that flash are about to attack, so watch out when they do that!
3026=Looks like Bohrin has you running an errand as usual, so I'll let you go. Come around for dinner if you want, my mom's making @6Snapfish Pie!@0

1122=Oh oh oh!| I bet you can use that to throw small amounts of energy for a quick @2ranged attack@0! Ya know, like we always used to throw rocks at each other... heh.
1123=Let's see if you can do it on this terribly mutated flora!| Oh boy I can't wait!| Just watch out for those tongue whips... @6gross@0.

//(10)Jungo=
1127=Oh, hello Flynn.| I'm sorry for not being my chirpy self at the moment, I've not seen my fishing buddy @1Rickathon@0 for a few days now.
1128=He usually meets me here at the break of dawn every day without fail..| I'm worried about him!
1129=I remember him telling me about scoping out a new fishing spot up on @3Mistral Peak@0, but that was the last I heard.
1130=Yikes, I hope he didn't get lost on his way up there! The last thing he said was 'yeehaw!' as he ran off... I sure hope those weren't his last words..
1131=I heard that you're heading to @3Mistral Peak@0 yourself..| Be careful Flynn and if you happen to see @1Rickathon@0 be sure to send him back here!

1132=I'm ever grateful, Flynn.| I thought he was a goner attempting to hike up that treacherous mountain.
1133=I don't have much of anything I can give you as a thank you..| I did however reel in this weird looking fish while you were gone,| you can have it.
1134=Thanks again, Flynn.

//(11)Rickathon=
1135=@6Help!!!!@0| I'm terrified of wolves..| @6HELP!@0| Why did I come here!?
1136=Thank you! Thank you so much!| That just makes me want to let out a big ol @6YEEHAW!@0 I thought they'd never leave me alone!
1137=I'm @1Rickathon@0 by the way, I only came up here to scope out this new fishing spot people have been talking about.
1138=I probably shouldn't have left so suddenly, who knew a scary mountain was dangerous! I can only imagine how worried my bud @1Jungo@0 is right now!
1139=Back down the mountain I go, I've certainly learned my lesson!| Thanks again brother, I'll hopefully see you back at @3Hollow's Isles@0 later!

1140=Hey brother, thanks again for helping me back there.| I'm never going up to that crazy place again!

1147=Sleep off the night in our home, you'll need all the energy you can gather!| @6(Standing here in the rain isn't the greatest idea)@0.

1148=Good morning, I hope you're well rested.| I'm sure you may be overwhelmed with your situation,| but Dex desperately needs your help.
1149=You'll find a @2Crimson Shrine@0 at the very tippity top of Mistral Peak nearby.| Sorry lad, but you have a lot of climbing ahead of you.
1150=The mountain has been overrun with Clublins over the last few years,| and they're @6not too welcoming to visitors.@0
1151=Good luck with your climb up @3Mistral Peak@0, you'll find answers there, I'm sure of it!| Loretta and her men have been fighting up there, keep an eye out for her!

//(13)Yombal (Relic Collector)=
1152=Yombal sad.| Yombal used to have so many shiny thing.| Now Yombal only have many shiny thing, not @6SO@0 many shiny thing.

1167=Feel free have a chat with my fellow friends around here..| Some stumbled on this place by accident, so I guess we're really not that hidden after all..

//(19)Fehl=
1168=Careful lad, up ahead is the route to @3Rustwood@0! It's a hazardous and creepy place full of bugs, toxic slime and darkness..| @6Not fun@0.
1169=The path to @3Rustwood@0 itself is very dangerous too, you'll most likely need a mount of some kind!

//(20)Tholmin=
1170=Would you look at that?| Flynn, right?| I've known @1Bohrin@0 for longer than I can remember, he's a champ for taking you under his wing. 
1171=Your parents would be proud if they could see you now.| The abomination of a man that caused all the suffering should be long gone now, though..
1172=@5Zealock@0..| the purest form of evil.| He wanted nothing but to see everything good in this world perish at his hands.

1173=@1Sorrell@0 and @1Allistair@0 sacrificed so much for the island,| your parents,| never forget them, Flynn.

1174=Oh!| You met my son @1Tholmin Jr.@0?| He's a brave little man..| loves guarding that lift that my tribe and I built many moons ago.
1175=Here, take my @1Clearcrest key@0.| Be careful though, those doors haven't been opened in a while!

1181=I'm sure you're aware of this spreading infection.| I've put it on me and my men to halt the spread of this dreaded @5Scourge@0, but we're all that's left.
1182=That @5damned man@0...| I can't even bring myself to say his name.| He's spreading his wrath again with these wretched portals.
1183=I know I don't need to tell you the importance of that weapon of yours.| I dearly wish I could be of more help, but these @6old bones@0 don't have much left for another war.

1184=Don't worry about us, we'll make our way down to @3Sanctia@0.| Your power is still raw. See me in town and I'll help toughen you up with new techniques.

1187=I might be getting old, but I can still show you some tricks I learned over my years on the battlefield.
1188=If you can bring me @2Crimson gems@0, I can use their energy to form new skills and abilities. I can also trade them for some roasted snapfish...
1189=I have enough Crimson gems to gather the energy for @2Charged Magic@0, go ahead and select it..

1190=Are you looking to learn a new skill, Flynn?

1191=Great!| I think you're ready to head up @3Mistral Peak@0.| Come back anytime with those @2Crimson gems@0 and we'll learn more!
1192=Wonderful, you're picking this up fast! 

1193=I've taught you all I know, Flynn. You've grown into quite the fighter! 

//(17)Loro (Twisted Wildwood Entrance)=
1163=Up ahead is the @3Twisted Wildwood@0 and here's a clue to not getting lost!
1164=Listen up:| To avoid losing your way, @6resist temptation and turn away@0.
1165=Whilst a @2prize@0 for you is worth the trial, the lesser worth passage is most worthwhile..

//(25)Loro (Twisted Wildwood Exit)=
1194=You made it out of that confusing place huh?| It's no lie that I am the creator of the @3Twisted Wildwood@0.
1195=The mountain is just too dangerous for people to stumble upon these days, so I was tasked to create a test of wit.
1196=I come down here every morning and use my staff to summon enchanted rain. It keeps the wildwood..| @6twisted@0.
1197=@3Mistral Peak@0 is up ahead, good luck!

//(30) Edith (Hot springs)=
1208=You're Flynn right?| Glad to see you finally made it up here..
1209=It's safe around these springs but don't be fooled, beyond the tranquil spring waters awaits danger.
1210=Only recently we've spotted what looks to be some kind of assassin-like being..| and it moves fast!
1211=Keep your wits about you, Flynn.

//(31) Edwin (Hot springs)=
1212=There you are!| It's about time you showed up.. 
1213=I know, I know..| those caverns can be quite the trek, they were once a thriving mining location but we abandoned them years ago.
1214=After the great war we realised that the mountain itself was on the verge of collapse and since then we've took measures to keep it stable.
1215=The beauty of this island though is that it sustains itself by the power of Crimson,| but unfortunately that attracts the attention of @6unwanted guests@0.

//(32) Ogden (Hot springs)=
1216=Be on your guard beyond this point, young one.| I overheard some quite disturbing chatter from across the chasm..
1217=It seems that @5Bora the Whirlwind Assassin@0 awaits your arrival...|

1220=If you will,| go and speak with my four Neptyn brothers to get caught up while I think of a way to fix this mess now that you're here.
1221=..Oh and tell them @1Remi@0 sent you, they can be a little rude otherwise.

1222=You spoke with my brothers?| Marvelous, you're ready.| I have a plan..
1223=Beyond the capital is the @3Crystal Grotto@0, our primary passageway to the palace.| Unfortunately, that place is ridden with Scourge magic and preventing us from leaving.
1224=Being of @2Crimson@0 blood, I'm sure that won't be an issue for you..| Our palace is on the other side of the grotto, that's where our king is being held.
1225=Here, let me raise the barricade..| Bring him back, Flynn.| Our people have a lot faith in you.

1250=Our king is being held beyond @3Crystal Grotto@0, if you can make it through there, you'll find him at the palace..| Good luck!

1251=Thank you so much, Flynn.| If it wasn't for you we would have been forced to give up the power of the @2Aquaras Shrine@0.
1252=Our King only speaks Neptynian, so I thank you on his behalf.
1253=As a token of our appreciation, take this @1Hollow Key@0.| You may have passed the door it unlocks in the @3Crystal Grotto@0.
1254=Thanks again, Flynn.| If you need anything, come by anytime.

//(34) Emba (Neptyn Capital)=
1226=Be gone with you.

1230=It's not safe in these parts, I wouldn't stick around..

1231=The king is safe, we're ever in your debt!

//(35) Lomai (Neptyn Capital)=
1232=..Not interested.

1233=Hmm..| You're not from around here are you?| Let me fill you in on a little secret of ours since @1Remi@0 believes you're worthy of being here.
1234=You've heard of the Great War haven't you?| Well, this here capital isn't a capital at all..
1235=This place is a facade..| After the island first fell victim to the hands of @5Zealock@0, we couldn't risk our Palace becoming a target so we built this place as a decoy.
1236=Unfortunately for us, it looks like he has figured that out..

1237=What are you, some kind of superhero?| We'll not forget this, thank you for rescuing our king!

//(36) Gambo (Neptyn Capital)=
1238=...

1239=I'm not into talking to strange folk like yourself, but a friend of @1Remi@0 is a friend of mine.
1240=Us Neptyn have been living under the island for centuries..| We rarely socialize with those above the surface unless it's essential.
1241=That doesn't mean we don't get along..| Damp, dark caverns are just our..| thing.| This is where we stay.
1242=@3Aquaras Palace@0 holds a strong connection with the @3Crimson Sanctuary@0 above ground, this is why it must remain a secre..| oops.

1243=You?| You are the son of @2Sorrell@0?| Why didn't you say so!| I'm sorry for calling you strange, thank you for all you have done to return our king!

1246=What, @1Remi@0 sent you?| @6(..to punish me I suppose)@0
1247=I was on guard and I swear I looked away for only a second..| he just..| vanished.| How can someone that big.. uh..| grand..| just disappear?
1248=I.. BLINKED| and @6poof@0.| I was blinded by a green flash and as my sight came back all that was left was..| @6King Nobody@0..

1249=@6You brought the king home!?@0| I'll never let my guard down, not even for a second!| Phew, thanks!

1260=.|.| @6WHAT!?@0| You're really him?| I mean..| I'm so sorry to hear about your parents, you must have been so young when..| it happened.
1261=The true Crimson legacy lives on!| I was afraid we were too late after your mother and father's sacrifice.
1262=There is still a lot I wish to learn about the power of Crimson and your family's history..| I'll leave you be though.

//(40) Dusk (Sanctia) - Axe Wall=
1263=...Scram!
1264=So you're the kid that's trying to save the world, huh.| Sorry to say kid, but this strange barrier won't shift, I've tried..| It's solid.
1265=Unless you can do something about it, @3The Hollow@0 is blocked off.|
1266=You're from the @2Crimson@0 bloodline?| That explains a lot..

//(41) Umbra (Sanctia)=
1267=So you're the guy I keep hearing muffled conversations about?| Flynn.. right?
1268=You should probably keep low like us..| Do you really want that kind of attention on you?| ..urgh, the idea of it makes me @6shudder@0.

1279=Hello..| Flynn, is it?| I know a lot about you and your past but more importantly,| @6your future@0.
1280=I can read into the future by mixing ingredients from around the island to make fortune telling blends of Neptynian tea. 
1281=Oh dear, today's blend is as bitter as the @5Scourge@0 itself..| It's not often the taste is so somber, my friend.
1282=With a tea so bleak brews a storm..

//Emmet (1 Dex orb)=
1293=Ah it's so great to see Dex back in Sanctia again!| We always enjoyed having you two come along with your shipments from Cardinal Island.
1294=Flynn, you've done great work already.. as should be expected from you after all.| Though I suppose you may be a bit confused with all this.
1295=As you've heard from me many times in the past, I knew your Father @1Allistair@0 very well. 
1296=Years ago, not long after your birth, we saw the end of a long war spanning across years that your father played a large role in.
1297=The war between @2Rosantica@0 and @5The Scourge@0 was sparked due to conflict between beings from a separate world from ours.
1298=There is more to @2Rosantica@0 than it seems, as I'm sure you've noticed in your journey so far. There is an alternate version of Rosantica, @6always watching| and waiting@0.
1299=We kept peace only thanks to @2Sorrell@0, your mother. Her naturally kind and warm nature was a bit too much for the other being, @5Zealock@0..
1300=Thus a large conflict began... and here we are.| Sanctia was once a very populated place before your birth, but we're doing our best to rebuild.
1301=I'm sorry for talking your head off, Flynn.| I will share information in time, but Dex still needs your help.

1302=I believe your next path will lead you into the sea caverns of @3The Hollow@0, you can access them via the caves below.| Please tell the Neptyns that Emmet sent you.

//Emmet (2 Dex orbs)=
1303=Flynn!| You've already done such an incredible job already with our past being thrown on you.| You did have Loretta's lessons since you were a wee lad after all.
1304=I'm so sorry you have to deal with all of our issues around here with the increasing number of monsters,| but you're quite a special one as I'm sure you've noticed.
1305=You've not gone far from @3Cardinal Island@0 in the past,| so I'm sure it has been a shock for you and that @2Crimson glow@0 to be recognized all around here.
1306=Your @2Crimson power@0 is a gift from @2Sorrell@0 herself,| an ability transferred down to you. You being her son and all,| of course.
1307=These shrines you can access are a link to the world of the @5Scourge@0 itself,| a place that hasn't always been the dark and sinister land it is now.
1308=Their purpose is to gather lingering Crimson energy from the Scourge,| and gift them to you on your journey in different forms.
1309=I'm quite proud of them myself!| I played a hand in their creation, I'm sure I have those blueprints somewhere...
1310=Of course, you know... Sorrell did most of the work activating them!| I take what I can get as a simple Rosantican villager.

1311=Speaking of Crimson.| With Dex's increasing energy, she can now be called at @2Guardian Posts@0 for help.| Try it out over at @3Shadowhaven Trail@0!

//Emmet (3 Dex orbs)=

1312=Great work, Flynn!| Dex is looking great now,| she just zoomed off with all that energy! She really is back to her old self.
1313=She had been helping us move lumber for new construction around here, but I suppose we'll need to find a new method!
1314=I've dreamt of these times since the war ended..| finally being able to rebuild with everyone's spirits up has been such a joy to witness.
1315=Though with our joy down here,| I'm sure you've noticed the large looming tower that has appeared near @3Mistral Peak@0.
1316=This is the @5Shivering Spire@0,| a truly evil tower originally laid deep in the @5Scourge@0. Sorrell shared tales of its downfall during the long war.
1317=Originally a place for archives and medicinal study,| @5Zealock@0 transformed it into a nefarious place for torture and vile experimentation.
1318=I'm not pleased to tell you that your next destination is located at the top of this very tower.| Dex must have sensed the source of this plague and headed there herself.
1319=I can feel @5Zealock's@0 rage growing closer with this Spire coming to our world.| Hurry, if you set off now, I'm sure you can catch up with Dex.

1320=You can reach the Shivering Spire from the @3Tempest Base@0 in Mistral Peak.| I see you have the ability to @2leap from walls@0, I'm sure you could use that to reach it.

//Emmet (OTHER) =

1321=Hurry, Flynn.| Dex needs her @2Guardian Spirits@0!


//Rozia (Shrine)=
1361=Ah...| so the weird red-haired boy I've heard so much about decided to show.| Father was right... you look @6dreadfully weak@0.
1362=This won't take long, then I'll execute everyone else on this dreaful island.| Rozia, @6destroyer of Cardinal Island@0 has a nice ring to it! @6Come at me!@0

1363=What have you @6DONE!?@0| I tinker with this for hours with no result and it chooses YOU?
1364=This is not what was supposed to happen...| There's no way you can control that @2Crimson Sword@0.
1365=It was supposed to be MINE! Ah well, more fun for me.| I'll just have to take it after I @6destroy you!@0

1366=@6Stupid Beast!@0| ..Get out of the way!
1367=Urgh, I don't have time for this..| I'll just have to take @6your power@0 instead.
1368=Heh heh, father will be proud.| This will do just fine.
1369=Don't get in my way again with your filthy mutt!

//(29) Rozia (Bleakstorm Ridge)=
1198=So you made it up here, huh?| Looks like the little child finally cooled down.
1199=I don't want to hear it about that filthy dog.| What's done is done. Don't let anything else get in my way.
1200=How disappointing..| You're as worthless as this stupid @2rock@0.| Here, you have it..| it's the same color as your dumb hair.
1201=I'm not wasting my energy on a troubled child..| come back and fight me when you learn to @2control your anger@0.

1202=I'm not wasting my energy on you, I let you beat me back at that miserable island of yours..
1203=Go play with your worthless @2rock@0 and don't come back until you can @2control your anger@0.

1204=Oh,| so the boy finally figured out how to control his anger issues?| I still have my doubts.. 
1205=..@6You won't be so lucky this time!!@0

1206=Ugh... @6AGAIN!?@0| Your power is supposed to be @6WEAK@0, what is happening?| No doubt you're getting help from @6HER@0.
1207=You'll never stop the @5Scourge@0,| it's spreading as we speak and I'm only here to waste your time @6you fool@0.| See you later..


// (Aquaras)=
1331=Ahh...| Just who I've been waiting for.| The little angry red-haired child.
1332=@6Ha ha!@0 Of course I kidnapped that fat whale!| It took a lot of energy to open a portal big enough for that oaf.
1333=He's over there.| Want to save him? You have to get past me.| Are you going to get help from mommy again?
1334=Whatever,| let's just get this over with.| I won't fail this time...| @6I can't.@0
1335=

1336=@6How is this possible!?@0| I've prepared all my life for this!| All that training from @5him@0...| no, this doesn't make sense.
1337=I've obtained so much power and yet @6you@0 can best me.| You, a @6nobody@0, beating me!| Rozia, the shadow of the Scourge!
1338=I @6NEED@0 more power..| I @6DESERVE@0 more power!
1339=It doesn't end this way!| @5He@0 won't be pleased..| but I need answers. I'll be back for you again.
1340=

//Rozia (Desolate Woods)=
1374=Hello again.| I'm really starting to get sick of seeing your face,| but my business with you isn't finished.
1375=You have to be stopped,| and yet you have a new power each time we face each other. How!? @2She@0 should be dead, they should all be dead!
1376=Tch... maybe I've spent too much time in this hideous land of yours.| It's making me weak like all you dreadful humans.
1377=Come at me one more time.| Show me what you have now, island boy.
1378=

1379=I knew it...| Ugh, he has been keeping me weak this whole time!| I can feel it when I fight you, my @5Scourge@0 power fighting against me.
1380=This heat from deep within...| something I've never felt before. I @6hate@0 that I can't understand it.
1381=I need @6more power!@0 I have to drown this out and find a way to harness it.
1382=This Scourge energy is nowhere near enough,| and I'm going to @6get what I deserve!@0
1383=Go on ahead.| I won't try stopping you again. I have other business to take care of.

//Rozia (Outside Citadel - Dead enemies around)=
1398=So this is what it comes to, huh?| Me... helping @6YOU!?@0| How depressing...
1399=Ugh...| I know I have no chance against @6him@0.| Not in this state, but you might.| Tch... how could he just throw me aside like this!
1400=He has been keeping me in the dark...| the thought of him stringing me along all this time makes me sick.
1401=I can feel something when I fight you,| something different...| and I @6hate@0 it.
1402=Now you know why I have no remorse for what's about to happen.| I even cleared out his guards for you,| you're welcome.
1403=Don't worry.| By the time you fail, I'll be back to full strength to finish the job.| Then I'll take my rightful place to rule over this land.
1404=Just get in there,| I'm sick of losing to you,| so I might as well use you.

//TALON (KS) (Desolate Woods)=
1370=Hm?| What do you want, kid?| My name?| It's Talon.| I'm searching for someone..
1371=A hooded figure has been known for tearing through the island and I'm here to stop them.| There's just no way they'll sneak by me..
1372=@6Huh!@0| Did you see that?| Whatever..| probably the wind.
1373=I'll stay guard here and keep watch.| Any strange folk will have to explain themselves to @6ME@0.

//KIT (KS) (Woodshade)=
1384=Hey!!| You're kind of a celebrity around here aren't you?| Flynn, right?
1385=I have no doubts in my mind that you'll keep the island safe with your wonderful friend, Dex.
1386=I only landed here a little while ago but I've already learned a lot about this island.| The energy this place radiates is..| @6out of this world@0.
1387=Stay safe out there, Flynn.| You should come visit my home once you're done being a superhero!

//Vera (KS) (Sanctia)=
1388=Hi I'm Flynn..| Wait no, sorry, my name is Yombal...| uh..| That's not right.

//Zuk (Noxious Rain Tut)=

1413=We rarely see humans in this part of the island.| I've heard that you people can't stand this @6beautiful weather@0, what a pity!
1414=If you must come through here, I suggest you stay under shelter.| I can only assume that your weakling skin is no match for this rain..
1415=Don't stay out in the open too long, weakling.| This @6wonderful rain@0 won't be very pleasant if it stays on your skin too long!

//Kyra (Volt Cloak Tut)=
1416=Oh hi there!| I'm just down here picking gazweed for my family.| There's nothing I wouldn't do for them, especially now that I'm expecting another child.
1417=This patch seems to thrive in most nutrient kinds of weeds.| It does however attract those silly volt wasps.| Watch out for those!
1418=I noticed you recently acquired some electric kind of magic.| I reckon that will come in very handy since volt cloaks don't stand a chance against real electricity!
1419=Enemies you see coated in that green stuff should be quickly diffused with your zippy zappy electrical magic before even touching.

1341=43 days after the war.| The experiments are moving along excellently.| Her power shows more potential than mine, but that will just not do.
1342=I've instructed them to use the @4emerald vial first@0 on the child.| Her powers must be suppressed,| and this concoction of mine will work perfectly.
1343=That wretched Crimson power...| More must be done to destroy these stains she has left across this land.
1344=172 days after the war.| The brainwashing commences soon.| Her power is being kept dormant.| We'll harvest it once we destroy the other child.
1345=Sorrell...| Even in death she undermines me through these children.| I will have my way,| I sense the barrier to Rosantica growing weaker with every moment.

1346=I've declared war on Sorrell and those pitiful Rosanticans.| Preparations have begun to destroy them.
1347=This land is completely under my command now.| Nothing can stand in my way with Sorrell's absence.| My Scourge energy is already mutating this world to my liking.
1348=Some citizens have started a rebellion, taking up the insignia of a @3blue diamond@0.| I've heard of their plans to escape to Rosantica from @3three@0 sources,| disgusting.
1349=I'll take Rosantica for myself soon enough.| They can run away all they want.| That other world will be mine.| Plans for corrupting that land are already set.
1350=Defectors will be given more severe torture,| if they make it out of the war alive.| I look forward to it.

1351=The war came to a bittersweet conclusion.| Sorrell and that man sacrificed their lives to banish me back here,| but I consider this a colossal victory.
1352=They put their futures in their worthless children,| and we captured one.| Sorrell, your efforts were meaningless.
1353=I can still feel her essence around here,| but there is nothing she can do now.| We'll raise the child as our own and use her against them.
1354=There is a barrier blocking my entrance back to Rosantica,| but we will work to dispel this.| I'll find a way through.
1355=@5Two@0 days under this @5purple moon@0 and I already feel back to full strength.| There is still work to be done.| I want what is MINE.

1356=That dreaded red woman,| she has discovered a new world parallel to ours.| She has only made small gateways so far, but I have loathed her discovery so far.
1357=Their world is full of useless, fragile beings.| Sorrell of course pities them and wants to make a connection.| How pointless.
1358=She has come to me @1four@0 times with new breakthroughs, I have turned her away every time.| I'm nothing but disgusted by the sight of their @1orange sun@0.
1359=Eight moons later,| and she has now made her way multiple times between worlds.| She believes I have no knowledge of this,| but I have eyes everywhere.
1360=I know of her discoveries there,| and connections made with those pathetic humans.| I will not have this.| Something has to be done to put a stop to it.

3041=This next gift should help you greatly. A weapon designed after @2Dex@0 herself, the swift and agile @2Crimson Claws@0 are now yours.
3042=This weapon will keep you in the air while attacking with fluid motion. Zealock's minions are no match for their speed.

3011=Flynn,| that wicked man is no match for your passion and determination, but his dreadful @5Scourge@0 power is breaking down the barrier between worlds.
3044=He will soon show himself to all of Rosantica,| and this enhancement will help you to confront him directly.
3045=With this gift, you now have the strength to @2Leap from walls@0 with your @2Crimson Claws@0. You will have no problem reaching his domain now.

3012=Take control of your energy, Flynn.| With @2Crimson Control@0, you can release @2Crimson@0 energy across your whole body in times of need.
3013=Build up your @2Crimson Control@0 meter by attacking enemies.| Once the meter is full, let your @2Crimson@0 power take over!

3015=Flynn,| you've done so well on this journey.| @5Zealock's@0 minions have been no match for your courageous efforts so far.
3016=All that is left to do is take him out once and for all..
